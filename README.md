What is the objective of the project ? : Developement of a console project run in a terminal. I chose to work on the quiz game where a user has to answer to some questions. I called an API in the project to generate existing questions with a specific difficulty level, category, type etc. If the user succeeds to answer correctly all the questions, he wins the game, else he fails. 

How to run the project ? : You can find the entire project on the dedicted repository on GitHub. Then, download the zip file of the project in local on your computer in a specific folder. Afterwards, you will have to go on the application anaconda previoulsy installed on your computer and launch spyder. The, open the main python file of the game called "quiz_game_dvp.py" in the specific folder. You can finally run the code and the project should work directy on the console. 

How to contribute ? Once you've installed all the project in local on your computer, you can then contribute to it. You can improve the source code and the game and add some informations on the readme for example. You have to use your console commander, go to the the specific folder of your game. and use git commands to send the modified project on GitHub and make it accessible for the other collaborators. You start by cloning your github repository on your computer by using he command git clone "linktothegithub".  You can add everythng you want on the project. Then,  use the command git add . to send the new Added local files to github. Then, use git commit -m "text on what you added".
